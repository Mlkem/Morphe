A single Morphe source for Music League, Walmart Canada, Wongnai, Zoom Earth,
PushPress and the XAPK merge-only utility.

## Install and update

The combined collection starts in **beta**. No combined stable release has passed
phone testing yet. In Morphe, open **Sources → + → Remote** and paste:

```text
https://github.com/Mlkem/Morphe/tree/dev
```

An explicit `dev` source enables prerelease updates from the start. Alternatively,
use the Add source link above and enable **Pre-release patches**. Enable
**Experimental app versions** for Walmart Canada and PushPress. Choose the original
app APK/APKM/XAPK, select patches, then patch and install. Keep your existing Morphe
APK signing key so future patched apps can update in place.

New GitHub releases update this source inside Morphe. You still tap to repatch and
install; source updates do not silently install apps. Local MPP downloads remain
available from Releases. Disable duplicate local sources for these apps.

## Collection status

| App / utility | Target | Included source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Music League | `com.musicleague.app` 1.4.9 | Recovered patch sources | Combined bundle awaits phone testing |
| Walmart Canada | `ca.walmart.ecommerceapp` 26.31 | 1.5.0-beta.1; 14 patches | Beta; Patch tools replaces Sparky |
| Wongnai | `com.wongnai.android` 12.11.0 | Ad fix 1.0.0 | Phone testing pending |
| Zoom Earth | `com.neave.zoomearth` 6.1 | LiteAPKS/9MOD popup removal | Requires the matching modified APK |
| PushPress Members | `com.pushpress.memberportal` 3.42.0 | CrossFit-only selector | Experimental; phone testing pending |
| Merge XAPK only | Universal | Merge-only 1.0.0 | Opt-in; uses Morphe's merge/sign flow |

The Music League Hermes patch, Walmart Remove Shop patch and universal merge utility
are off by default. Walmart price history records prices you actually encounter;
it does not provide past prices from a remote database. See [Walmart details](docs/apps/walmart-canada.md).

## Release channels

- **Beta:** `feat:` and `fix:` commits on `dev` build, verify and publish a prerelease.
  Morphe reads `dev/patches-bundle.json` for this channel.
- **Stable:** publication is manual on `main`, requires the phone-tested checkbox
  and a passing approval record matching the current source. Until that happens,
  there is no stable collection manifest. See [phone testing](docs/phone-testing.md).
- Pull requests and pushes to `main` are built and checked without publishing.
- Releases retain downloadable MPP files, release notes and source snapshots.

Private personal patches are excluded from **every branch, commit and release** of
this collection. Private variants remain separately stored; a public branch cannot
provide privacy.

## Development

Use JDK 21 and the included Gradle wrapper. The official Morphe Gradle plugin uses
GitHub Packages: set `GITHUB_ACTOR` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` with package read access, or
local `gpr.user` / `gpr.key` properties. GitHub Actions supplies its scoped token.

```sh
./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid :patches:generatePatchesList --no-daemon
python3 scripts/verify_bundle.py
python3 scripts/test_walmart_logic.py
./gradlew -p tests/walmart/android test --no-daemon
```

Output: `patches/build/libs/patches-<version>.mpp`.
An offline verification path accepts supplied official Morphe Desktop, Kotlin,
Android and R8 JARs; see `python3 scripts/build_offline.py --help`.

Patch sources are under `patches/src/main/`; injected app code is under `extensions/`.
See [maintenance](docs/maintenance.md), [provenance](docs/provenance.md) and [app notes](docs/apps/).
